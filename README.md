The rapid growth of motor vehicles without adequate advances in road safety has resulted in enormous loss of human life. With the growing population, the use of cars has also increased, which has led to increased traffic, road hazards and more traffic accidents. One of the causes of a person's death in a car accident is also the unavailability of first aid due to the inability of rescuers to collect details about the accident in time and then send the appropriate rescue services to the scene of the accident. An accident can involve multiple victims, so it is important to provide an adequate number of emergency services to save all victims. The ideal situation for survival after an accident is that emergency services approach the scene of the accident as quickly as possible. In your work, analyze the current state of rescue centers, the technologies used and needed to effectively evaluate the severity of an accident without the need for a human. Also analyze available data, respectively datasets from previous traffic accidents. Design a system that will be based on information collected in real time while the vehicle is driving and will then evaluate this data. Implement an intelligent web-based system for rescue centers that uses artificial intelligence to evaluate the severity of a traffic accident and automatically allocate the appropriate number of emergency services to be dispatched to the scene of the accident. Verify the proposed solution on the collected data in real time while the vehicle is driving and evaluate the result.
